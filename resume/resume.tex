			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{project rev}: Researched, designed and led the architecture and development of an audio-interactive personalizable chatbot. [Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP)]
				\item \textbf{Analysystem}: Implemented a financial analysis system using Google Apps Script API for a large-scale content publisher. Extensively optimized the sheet to run as quickly as possible under Google Sheet limitations. Helped remodel the UI to achieve better load times. [JavaScript]
				\item \textbf{Nabd}: Implemented internationalization, Uber-like ambulance tracking, and designed most of the user interface (UI) scenes and forms, contributing to the app becoming a \$60,000 government award finalist. [JavaScript, React Native]
				\item \textbf{Othello (Reversi)}: Created a basic Othello (Reversi) game implementation that is playable by both humans and general minimax alpha-beta pruning agents. [Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI)]
				\item \textbf{kabsa}: Built a compiler using Bison \& Flex C++ interfaces that generates code for a hypothetical stack-based machine. [C++, Lex, Yacc]
				\item \textbf{Battleships Game}: Developed the famous battleships guessing game, specifically the ships-placement mechanism and simulated scrolling chat using queues data structure and 8086 Assembly graphics mode. [8086 Assembly]
				\item \textbf{Doclense}: Contributed to the development of an OCR web app by implementing a text separation algorithm in addition to dataset and classifier model creation. [Python, Image Processing, Neural Networks]
				\item \textbf{32-bit RISC Pipelined Processor}: Implemented a regex-based assembler and modelled the memory stage of a 5-stage 32-bit pipelined processor. [Python, VHDL]
				\item \textbf{E7gzly API}: Created, designed and documented a RESTful API for a football matches ticket reservation web app. [Python, Django, Database Systems]
